# Modular Javascript 
---

#### Javascript on the Object Literal Pattern 

- Self-Contained module 
  - Everything to do with my module is in my module.
  - No global variables.
  - If a module manages more than one thing it should be split up.

- Separation of concerns

- DRY code: Don't Repeat Yourself

- Efficient DOM usage
  - Very few $(selections)
  
- No memory leaks
 - all events can be unbound
